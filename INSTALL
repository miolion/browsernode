To install this library you are going to need latest libavg and latest
Chromium Embedded Framework compiled. Refer to their respective docs.

The project uses cmake build system. It is recommended to use cmake-gui
as you are required to manually set CMAKE paths to libavg and cef directories.

On windows, the usage of the libavg prebuilt dependency package is advised.


The process after having libavg and CEF built is as follows:

-run cmake-gui
-select browsernode directory and build output directory
-run configure, choose your designated compiler(VS2010 and make recommended)
-fill in/modify missing elements in the view.
 Linux:
	-AVG_BUILD_DIR: AVG build directory.

 Windows: 
	-AVG_DEPENDENCY_INCLUDE_DIR: AVG dependencies include directory.
	-AVG_DEPENDENCY_LIBRARIES: AVG dependencies lib directory.
	-AVG_LIB_PATH: Path to the built avg.lib.

 Both:
	-CEF_WRAPPER_LIB: Path to libcef_dll_wrapper.a/lib
	-CEF_DIR: CEF binary release directory from http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/index.html
	-AVG_DIR: AVG directory.(Preferably latest source from git)

 Optionally:
	-RELEASE_DIR: Where output, test files will be copied. Defaults to <build>/Release

-hit configure again. If any errors occur, resolve them based on message.
-hit generate.

After this you can find project files in your designated binary directory.

All the resource files used by CEF, along with a test python file are included
in the designated release directory.
On unix a copy of your python2.7 is also generated, as its necessary as
otherwise CEF would look for dependencies in /usr/bin/

You can run the test in the Release directory with:
"./mypy testapp.py" on unix
"python testapp.py" on windows
